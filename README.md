# CS-230 Final Project: Draw It or Lose It!

*Draw It or Lose It!* is an application that the client, **The Gaming Room**, has consulted **Creative Technology Solutions (CTS)** to aid in the application’s development process. The proposed application will be a web app where a given number of teams of players compete to guess what is being drawn. The drawn images will be fetched from a stock library of drawings that gradually become more complete.

I had previous experience with creating software documentation, so I feel as though I was able to clearly express and explain ideas through writing. 

Working on a design document while developing the application was interesting because I was forced to organize the structure of the application before moving on with my implementation.

If I were to revise part of the design document, I would revise the initial requirements to be a bit more in depth and explain some of the hardware restrictions. I would also communicate more with the client to find more clarity on some vague client specifications.

While interpreting how the user's needs interacted with the client specifications, I kept in mind the hardware restrictions of mobile devices, including lower end cell phones, in order to distribute the client's product to as many users as possible. This is important not just for expanding the customer base, but also to improve the user's experience of the product.

The UML diagram was extremely helpful for organizing the relationships between different classes in the application. I will use UML diagramming more in the future to have a firm overview of what the application should look like before starting the code implementations.
